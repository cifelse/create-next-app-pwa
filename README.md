# Create Next.js Progressive Web App
The script for the `npx create-next-app-pwa` command. Making it easier for everyone to create a Next.js Progressive Web App using a simple command. This is made possible by the service worker made by [@serwist/next](https://github.com/serwist/next).

## Installation
It's easy. Just run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npx create-next-app-pwa [project-name]
```

This will follow the standard `create-next-app` command so this means that you will be asked a couple of questions like the following below.
```
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … No / Yes
```
After answering the questions, it will start the installation process. It's like installing a normal Next.js app.
